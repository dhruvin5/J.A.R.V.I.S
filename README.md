## J.A.R.V.I.S

Voice activated assistant which  takes commands from the user and works accordingly.

Does day to day tasks for user like writing notes, sending emails,sending messages over whatsapp. 

And for it to interact with the user ,it uses Speech recognition ie the process of converting audio into text. 

This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. 

Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing


# Requirements:

* tkinter -  to deal with the GUI part

* Pyaudio - to take audio input

* pyttsx3 - converts  text to speech in python

* speech_recognition - to recognize the voice input

* Wikipedia -  to integrate wikipedia with the code

* Googlesearch -  to search google

* Pyjokes -  for random jokes

* Webbrowser -  to open things in browser

* Smtplib -  for emailing

* Re -  for regular expression

* Selenium  - for whatsapp

* Pillow -  for image rendering

Other Libraries used:

* Datetime, json, random, operator, os, subprocess, time, pylint ,winshell ,sys

## Future Scope

A lot can be done with this project. Core AI chatbot like functionality can be added. More python scripts can be associated. Also integrating  it with frameworks like Django,Flask we can make it  a proper assistant with a better user interface  and a stronger backend. This is still a basic version wherein prefeeded instructions can only be used, but using AI-ML we can go to a higher level increasing the scope of application of the concept. From doing basic tasks to complex ones JARVIS can be a all-in-one-thing.  As new and new libraries related to AI are being developed , JARVIS can be upgraded to be a  smart and friendly assistant.
